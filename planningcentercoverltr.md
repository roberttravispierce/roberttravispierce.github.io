Hello Jeff, Aaron, and Planning Center team,

Please consider me for your Full Stack Developer position.

Seeing the words “Planning Center” come across my email client in the jobs.gorails.com listing got my attention recently. I have not been actively searching for a new Rails position, but that changed my mind quickly!

You see, I’m familiar with your Planning Center Services product and have used it in my past position at Three Angels Broadcasting. I thought: what an opportunity to use my talent stack and experience to help a team that is doing church support in a big way! Reading the job listing and researching your team and mission increased my excitement and resolution to apply.

Why consider me?

- I meet or exceed all your stated requirements (residency, eligibility, travel availability, competency).

- I am a seasoned Ruby on Rails web application developer who is experienced with the necessary skills to greenfield, grow and maintain business solutions applications via the web. I know how to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain Rails apps across the entire technical stack, including the tasks you described in the job’s typical work week.

- I love building things and creating solutions to problems. It’s why I got into software development—a business leader I worked with asked me to help them solve a business problem. I dug in and had success. Rinse and repeat—I was hooked, and still am.

- I know how to add value as a member of a development team. I work well with others and lead by serving. I know how to manage projects and teams when necessary.

- I have served in churches and Christian ministries for over 30 years in many capacities (worship and team leader, administration, media & publishing, etc.); all of which have given me insight into some of their unique management and support needs in serving members and communities.

- I have a professional background in graphic design, publishing, and multimedia. I’m the kind of developer who can be trusted to access a Design Team’s Figma system and comment, suggest, implement, and add value to their efforts—without irritating them. :)

- I have good writing, editorial, and proofreading skills. As you know, these are valuable (and sometimes rare) skills in a software development team member.

What about rest?

- I maintain an active lifestyle (Crossfit, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, etc.) and have learned that good rest is a critical factor of good health and fitness. Every day I strive to sleep 7-8 hours, meditate, pray, walk, exercise, and eat well. Working at a Seventh-day Adventist ministry for over five years has sold me on the value and effectiveness of a four-day work-week and taking a sabbath rest weekly.

- With an entire month of paid vacation, I would take Tammie, my wife of 36 years, on a long vacation to the ocean coast—her dream vacation. Between the demands of raising four children to adulthood and work/ministry, we have never had a “real” vacation. We’d walk along the beach, rest, and hire a chef to make healthy meals for the duration. Finally, I’d enjoy attempting to catch up on a few decades of reading backlog waiting on bookshelves and Kindle. :)

Finally...

I would consider it an honor to join the Planning Center team. I have a special place in my heart for the staff and volunteers of churches (having been there, done that) and the challenges they face. The idea of being able to serve them by creating and improving tools to help them succeed, while I work for a great company and with a great team, is a dream job. For me, it would be an amazing convergence of my experience, talent stack, passion, and mission.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely in the grace of Jesus Christ,

—Robert Pierce
